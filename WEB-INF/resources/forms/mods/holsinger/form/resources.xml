                <identifier> At least one identifer is required. The DLF/Aquifer Implementation
                    Guidelines for Shareable Metadata Records recommend the use of at least one
                    identifier element with the type attribute containing appropriate values in each
                    MODS record. This element is repeatable.</identifier>
                <identifiertype>Required. All occurrences of the identifier element must contain the
                    type attribute to indicate the type of the identifier. If a local identifier is
                    used, it should be indicated as such using the local value.</identifiertype>
                <title>Title Help Needed</title>
                <titletype>All additional titles must designate a type.</titletype>
                <titleInfo>The DLF/Aquifer Implementation Guidelines for Shareable MODS Records
                    require the use in all records of at least one titleInfo element with one title
                    subelement. Other subelements of titleInfo are recommended when they apply. This
                    element is repeatable. </titleInfo>
                <subtitle>The subtitle element is used to record a part of a title deemed secondary
                    to the core portion. The guidelines recommend the use of this element when a
                    subtitle is present, rather than including the subtitle in the text of the title
                    element. When using the subTitle element, do not include punctuation at the end
                    of the title element intended to delineate the title from the
                    subtitle.</subtitle>
                <nonSort>The nonSort element contains characters, including initial articles,
                    punctuation, and spaces that appear at the beginning of a title that should be
                    ignored for indexing of titles. The guidelines strongly recommend the use of
                    this element when non-sorting characters are present, rather than including them
                    in the text of the title element. Examples include : 'The' or 'A'. Do not
                    include these character in the title field, but rather include them only in the
                    nonSort field. </nonSort>
                <partname>The partName element is used for a part or section name of a title. Use
                    partName to describe the section or division titles of the digital object (for
                    example, a chapter title, episode name, or an audio or video clip). The
                    guidelines recommend the use of this subelement when a part name is present,
                    rather than including the part name in the text of the title element. When using
                    the partName element, do not include punctuation at the end of the preceding
                    element intended to delineate the part name from previous parts of the
                    title.</partname>
                <partnumber>The partNumber element is used for a part or section number of a title.
                    partNumber may describe the section of the digital object (for example, an
                    episode number or an audio or video clip). partNumber may follow title or
                    subTitle as appropriate. The guidelines recommend the use of this subelement
                    when a part number is present, rather than including the part number in the text
                    of the title element. When using the partNumber element, do not include
                    punctuation at the end of the preceding element intended to delineate the part
                    number from previous parts of the title.</partnumber>

                <typeofresource>For the purposes of records created according to these guidelines,
                    information in typeOfResource is about the original item. For example, in the
                    case of a digitized photograph, typeOfResource would apply to the analog
                    original; in born-digital materials, it would apply to the original digital
                    format.</typeofresource>
                <date>The guidelines recommend recording each date in a structured form rather than
                    a textual form. When a date is uncertain or cataloger-supplied, indicate this
                    through the use of the qualifier field rather than inserting characters such as
                    "ca.", brackets or a question mark as part of the date string. When only a
                    decade is known, enter a date range for the entire decade and mark the date as
                    questionable. When only a century is known, enter a date range for the entire
                    century and mark the date as questionable.</date>
                <qualifier>Best practice is to use this attribute with the appropriate value when a
                    date is approximate, inferred, or questionable, rather than inserting characters
                    such as "ca.", brackets or a question mark within the date string.</qualifier>
                <place>Record in place names associated with the creation or issuance of a resource.
                    Place should be omitted if no information about the originating place of the
                    resource is known.</place>
                <publisher>Publisher is a named entity determined to be the publisher or originator
                    for a resource. Descriptive standards such as AACR2 may be used to format the
                    name of the publisher. Information about an institution responsible for
                    digitizing and delivering online a previously published resource should be
                    included in note, rather than in publisher.</publisher>

                <subject>Subject Help Needed</subject>
                <edition>The edition element is used to provide an edition statement for a published
                    work. Descriptive standards such as AACR2 and DACS may be used to determine if
                    an edition statement should be recorded and in what format. If no edition
                    statement applies to the resource, do not include the edition element.</edition>
                <name>The DLF/Aquifer Implementation Guidelines for Shareable MODS Records recommend
                    the use of at least one name element to describe the creator of the intellectual
                    content of the resource, if available. Include as many name elements for
                    contributors as are readily available. For textual materials, include the names
                    of all known authors, translators, and/or editors. For images, include the name
                    of the creator of the original intellectual content (photographer, painter,
                    architect, etc.) and the name of anyone capturing that content in a new medium
                    (for a photograph of a building, include both the architect and the
                    photographer). If the creator is unknown or anonymous, do not include "unknown,"
                    "anonymous," or a similar indication in the MODS records for aggregation.</name>

                    is not a LCSH record</nameauthority>
                <namerole> Adapter Use for a person or organization who 1) reworks a musical
                    composition, usually for a different medium, or 2) rewrites novels or stories
                    for motion pictures or other audiovisual medium.<br/> Arranger Use for a person
                    or organization who transcribes a musical composition, usually for a different
                    medium from that of the original; in an arrangement the musical substance
                    remains essentially unchanged. Attributed name Use for an author, artist, etc.,
                    relating him/her to a work for which there is or once was substantial authority
                    for designating that person as author, creator, etc. of the work. UF Supposed
                    name Author Use for a person or organization chiefly responsible for the
                    intellectual or artistic content of a work, usually printed text. This term may

                    digital resource, including explicitly mentioning lack of copyright restrictions
                    when the digital resource is in the public domain. Also provide contact

                    information relating to specific digital resources on a web site, you may wish
                    to provide a URL for that web site in lieu of a textual rights statement. When
